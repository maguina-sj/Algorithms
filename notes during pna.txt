if you can talk what you know very well, create a 1 -3 min video about it
vinmeo , youtube and put url on the resume 
do not sell the app, selling the skills
once sentence top about what it is, list out languages and techs to make it
also say WHY you did what
make an accomplishment statement - summarizing what you did, why you did
it 
an employer wants to know how and why of an app, not necessarily what it is
strong action verb to start with and what tech was used, what tech did and why 
that tech
work experience: can't change much but whatever experience is relevant
education is at the bottom
